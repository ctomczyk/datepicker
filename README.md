# Datepicker

Simple date picker written in JavaScript - accessible, fast and no dependencies from 3rd party libraries.

## Usage

* Just add class name `datepicker` to HTML `input` element. Example: `<input class="datepicker" type="text" id="test" name="test" value=""/>`
* Translations are located in file datepicker.js where is section named `/* Config */`. There you can translate months, days, set arrows for next/previous month and many more.

## Some TODO

- Navigation with keyboard doesn't work yet.
- Improving accessibility.
- Improving translations (Internationalization) by moving from local variable to JSON file.
- Optimizing code.
